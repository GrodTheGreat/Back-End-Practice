# Back End Practice
This repo is a place to store some projects as I practice Back End Programming

## Projects
## Languages
  - Python
  - JavaScript (Node.js)
  - Java
  - C#
  
### Project 1: Simple "Hello, World!" Web Server
**Overview:**
Create a basic web server in each language that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed.

**Skills/Technologies:**
- Basic syntax and structure of Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Java, and C#
- Setting up a basic web server (Flask for Python, Express for Node.js, Spring Boot for Java, ASP.NET Core for C#)

**Focus:**
- Understanding the fundamentals of HTTP requests and responses
- Getting familiar with the development environment and tools

### Project 2: Static File Server
**Overview:**
Expand the web server to serve static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) from a directory.

**Skills/Technologies:**
- File I/O in each language
- Middleware (for example, using `express.static` in Node.js)

**Focus:**
- Handling file paths and serving static content
- Basic routing and middleware usage

### Project 3: Basic REST API
**Overview:**
Create a simple REST API that supports CRUD operations on a resource (e.g., a list of books).

**Skills/Technologies:**
- RESTful design principles
- Creating and handling routes/endpoints
- JSON data format

**Focus:**
- Building and testing REST endpoints
- Handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

### Project 4: User Authentication
**Overview:**
Add user authentication (sign up, login, logout) to your REST API using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

**Skills/Technologies:**
- User authentication and authorization
- JWT for stateless authentication
- Password hashing and security best practices

**Focus:**
- Implementing secure user authentication
- Understanding and managing user sessions

### Project 5: Database Integration
**Overview:**
Integrate a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to persist data for your API.

**Skills/Technologies:**
- Database setup and configuration
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) or direct database queries

**Focus:**
- Designing database schemas
- Performing CRUD operations with a database

### Project 6: File Upload and Management
**Overview:**
Add functionality to your API to handle file uploads (e.g., images, documents) and store them on the server or in cloud storage.

**Skills/Technologies:**
- Handling multipart/form-data
- Integrating with cloud storage services (optional)

**Focus:**
- Managing file uploads and storage
- Validating and processing uploaded files

### Project 7: Advanced Routing and Middleware
**Overview:**
Implement advanced routing features like nested routes, parameterized routes, and custom middleware for logging and error handling.

**Skills/Technologies:**
- Advanced routing concepts
- Custom middleware development

**Focus:**
- Structuring complex routes
- Implementing reusable middleware

### Project 8: Asynchronous Programming and Background Jobs
**Overview:**
Incorporate asynchronous programming to handle long-running tasks, such as sending emails or processing data, without blocking the main thread.

**Skills/Technologies:**
- Asynchronous programming (async/await, Promises)
- Task queues and background job processing (e.g., Celery for Python, Bull for Node.js)

**Focus:**
- Writing non-blocking code
- Managing background tasks

### Project 9: WebSockets and Real-Time Communication
**Overview:**
Implement real-time features using WebSockets, such as a chat application or live notifications.

**Skills/Technologies:**
- WebSocket protocol
- Real-time communication libraries (e.g., Socket.IO for Node.js, SignalR for C#)

**Focus:**
- Establishing and managing WebSocket connections
- Handling real-time data updates

### Project 10: Microservices Architecture
**Overview:**
Break down your application into smaller, independent services that communicate via APIs or messaging queues.

**Skills/Technologies:**
- Microservices design principles
- API gateways and service discovery
- Messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)

**Focus:**
- Designing and implementing microservices
- Managing inter-service communication and data consistency

### Additional Considerations:
- **Version Control:** Use Git for version control and familiarize yourself with branching and merging strategies.
- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for your code using frameworks like pytest (Python), Mocha (Node.js), JUnit (Java), and xUnit (C#).
- **Deployment:** Learn how to deploy your applications to cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
- **Security:** Implement security best practices, such as input validation, secure data storage, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
